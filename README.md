# Day 3 - Keyboard

## My Demo

## Brief

In this project, we're creating a keyboard. I love this project because at first glance it seems easy, but there are some more complicated steps involved.

## Challenge

Within the _STARTER-FILES_ folder, you'll find everything you need to get started.

Users should be able to:

- See the keyboard centered on the page
- Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors 
  - White keys will change to yellow #ffd200
  - Black keys will change to pink #f40082
- When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip. 
  - The audio clips are numbered, but I did not specifically number the keys. You can pick which key should be associated with each audio file.
  - If a user clicks on one key, then immediately clicks on a second key. The 2 files should both play. Meaning, clicking on one key will not stop an existing audio file from playing.
